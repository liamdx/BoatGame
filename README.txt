This Project is based on the Unreal Engine 4 Content examples render target fluid system.
All additional complex features are created by me using blueprints.
It was created in my free time without any sponsoring.

You are free to use this complex water system in any project: free, indie or commercial.
Anyways, giving a little credit somewhere would make me happy :D

Why is it free?
- 1. I can't provide lifetime support
- 2. I am no programmer and I may not be able to fix limitations or issues

Important sidenote:

- use two sided materials for better simulation!!!
