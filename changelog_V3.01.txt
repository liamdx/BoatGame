V3.01 31.01.2019

Small Bugfixes:
- pixelation effect changed to integer variable
- placed some is valid nodes in GlobalUpdater_BP and WaterBody_BP to avoid errors and low fps when there is no player0
- disabled scenecapture when player0 is not valid to avoid low fps when player0 is not valid



V3.0 27.01.2019

New Features:

- now 3 demo levels
- Player Local Simulation (only 1 single plane)
- automatic water interaction as long as actor and component has tag "water" or "waterlocal"
- Water interaction cause waves in shape of object
- Water Simulation can be tweaked to massive distances
- massive performance improvements
- splashes on shallow water (calculated by character_BP)
- water splash color based on actor tag of water body (red, green, blue)
- Impact at location Function/Blueprint added
- Rain at location Function/Blueprint added
- Particle Rain Blueprint added
- tesselation by distance and falloff option
- Particle interaction
- now only what touches water surface causes waves (precise edge)
- over water and under water touch offset
- increased water surface precision
- interactive Water Jet (Press N)
- spawn dynamic objects (Press B)
- fake buoyancy (needs to add collision channel "BuoyancySurface" in project settings!)
- under water post Process volume
- char arm rotation influenced by water level (calculated by character_BP)
- character speed influenced by water level (calculated by character_BP)
- World Space Tiling of water surface
- tiling in water body settings
- yaw rotation is now properly possible
- debuging components and exposed options
- Render Target resolution and capture resolutions is now editable
- wave orientation can now be set to up or downwards
- object idle speed variable
- an activation box with offset options
- wave noise reduction option
- pixelation effect
- local planar reflection (needs to be support global clip plane in project settings checked)
- rain around player option
- basic caustics
- self caustics
- grass is influenced by waves


Bugfixes:

- fixed black debug planes in editor
- fixed collision happening out of waterbounds

Known issues:

- impact and rain at location Impact Powers are the same for impacts at the very same moment
- on lower simulation distances combined with high damping value random waves might appear
- tessellated impacts height is sometimes not visible infront of translucent materials





V2.1:
04.12.2018


Minor Bugfixes:

- deleted unused variables
- flipped calf and feet collision checkbox (now its correct)
- decreased plane size in demo level for faster project startup


V2:
21.10.2018

New Features:
- framerate independant simulation
- support multiple water plane actors with different materials and settings possible
- water plane indicators in editor
- improved performance


Performance:

- deactivated translucentcy on planar reflection + 25%fps
- deactivated dynamic shadows on planar reflection + 5%fps
- Blueprint communication overhaul
- new settings for performance (tick rates for location and simulation
- adjustable water tile size


Materials:

- UV Tiling is working now (but only with odd numbers 1,3,5...)
- better material layout
- emmissive is now optional
- material adjustments for proper color settings
- new subcategories for material instances
